          <p>In 2017, a former co-worker called me and told me about an opportunity at Fabric.com, an e-commerce company/warehouse in Kennesaw, Georgia. They were looking to rewrite their website using React.js. I had just finished a sizeable React.js project a few months prior, so this was an excellent opportunity to continue expanding my experience.</p>
          <p>In the past five years, I’ve rewritten the front-end of their checkout application, spun up a CMS and developed a new homepage, led a team of junior developers to reimagine the site’s product detail page, and led a Scrum team of senior developers to rewrite legacy .NET applications and graceful deprecations. Most of the new applications used React.js and Next.js, and I used Web Components for any UI elements used across stacks.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I’ve instilled high standards in the organization, including accurate estimates, high-quality documentation, best practices related to Git, and automated testing/high code coverage. I’ve also managed several Optimizely campaigns, led the company’s Customer Experience Committee, and spearheaded accessibility initiatives.</p>

Starting in the primaries, a team of five people created a data-driven website connected to AP data sources and presented users with live data as voting results were released. The app was built in React.js and reached an audience of thirteen million unique visitors and two million concurrent visitors at its peak.</p>
          <p>Other contributions included a site redesign from 2012 to 2013, updates to the now-defunct iReport social platform, several branded-section redesigns, and a few internal story-telling tools.</p>

          <li>Built the 2016 Election Center website with React.js in four months, which supported millions of unique visitors</li>
          <li>Created head-to-head trackers that tallied the votes for each candidate, ensuring that developers tagged UI elements with ARIA labels to add context, such as what a checkmark next to a candidate meant</li>
          <li>Used <code>data</code> attributes to theme elements for each political party (for example, Democrat elements in blue, Republican elements in red, etc.)</li>
          <li>Challenged stakeholders and designers to prioritize features that would give vital information to first-time voters, such as “what is a Super Delegate?”</li>
          <li>Developed UI elements for embargoed data 12 hours before launch after realizing we initially forgot to account for time zones in our launch plan</li>
          <li>Worked diligently with other developers and QA to deliver an experience with an immovable deadline and zero defects</li>

              <p>2011 was the year that I decided to go all-in and become a developer. I opened my business, packed all my life’s belongings in a smart® Car, and relocated to Georgia.</p>
              <p>Delta offered me an opportunity to help rebuild their website. After merging with Northwest Airlines, Delta had hired Razorfish to design a new experience and several contractors to help deliver. They uprooted and rewrote everything: databases, server logic, front-end website, mobile website, and their mobile app. It was an exciting experience.</p>
              <p>I primarily focused on their loyalty Delta SkyMiles® program dashboards. Logged-in users could transact by buying, selling, gifting, and donating miles. Several checks were also in place to ensure the customer met all necessary conditions like sufficient balances or business-imposed minimums and maximums.</p>

              <li>Led foreign and domestic front-end development teams through the construction of multi-lingual e-commerce, loyalty web apps, and a sitewide widget application that allowed users to find and book travel</li>
              <li>Worked with Razorfish designers and developers to integrate a destination-discovery service (now Delta Vacations) which allowed users to book air travel and hotels from a stylized Google Maps UI</li>
              <li>Collaborated with a globally-distributed team in the United States (Atlanta, GA, and Minneapolis, MN) and India</li>
              <li>Worked closely with Java developers to create JSP pages using Struts2 and AJAX to send and receive data</li>

              <p>My first job out of college was for an industrial manufacturing company. Smart Vent Products, Inc. (under the umbrella of Smart Product Innovations, Inc.) developed patented wet-floodproofing vents that would help protect homes and businesses during floods.</p>
              <p>When I joined, they were also planning to release a consumer product for dispensing paper towels without having to touch anything.</p>
              <p>I spent half my time designing things such as flyers, retail boxes, and instruction manuals; I mostly created ads. I also told them I could build their website.</p>
              <p>As it turns out, an art school doesn’t provide the necessary training to build commercial-grade internet sites. We worked with a contractor in Colorado who helped teach me what a CMS was, and on my own, I took classes for JavaScript and jQuery (because everything I learned about Flash was proving worthless at the time).</p>

              <p>Stuzo is where my professional web experience started. At the time, Facebook Pages allowed brands to create custom games and sweepstakes on their platform, and Stuzo was one of the top-five partners Facebook recommended.</p>
              <p>Not much glory in this job; I spent a lot of time splicing graphics designed by somebody else to hand them over to developers in Scandinavia. I include this story because this is when I read the book “Don’t Make Me Think” by Steve Krug. And thus, my quest to build great interfaces began.</p>
